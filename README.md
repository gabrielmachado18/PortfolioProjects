# PortfolioProjects
Hi there!

That's my first porfolio project.

**Project Description: COVID-19 Data Analysis**

This project uses SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Data Selection:** We start by picking relevant data like location, date, cases, deaths, and population.

2. **Brazil's Mortality Rate:** We calculate how deadly COVID-19 is in Brazil by finding the percentage of deaths among total cases.

3. **Infection Rate in Brazil:** We figure out what percentage of Brazil's population has been infected.

4. **Global Insights:** We look at countries with the highest infection rates and countries with the highest death rates compared to their populations.

5. **Continental Analysis:** We also examine continents with high death rates compared to their populations.

6. **Vaccination Data:** We integrate vaccination data to see how many people are getting vaccinated over time.

7. **Cumulative Vaccination Counts:** We track the total number of vaccinations given, helping us understand the progress of vaccination efforts.

8. **Data Organization:** We use techniques like Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables for efficient data processing.

9. **Creating Views:** We create views to simplify data visualization using tools like PowerBI or Tableau.

This project aims to provide insights into COVID-19's impact on a global scale, helping us better understand the pandemic's progression and vaccination efforts.
